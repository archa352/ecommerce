"""Fine-grained admin permissions.

ADMIN accounts can do everything. A STAFF account carries an explicit list
of permissions. A STAFF account whose list was never set (NULL -- every staff
account created before permissions existed) keeps exactly the access staff
always had: the read-only admin screens, and nothing new.
